# Make 20 React Apps Site

This is the code for the sales site for [MakeReactApps.com](https://MakeReactApps.com).

Making this a public repo so you can take a look at how I made the site. It uses:

💪 Generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
⭐️ Styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
🤓 Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Love this stack. Most everything is default Tailwind classes with a few custom things going on.
